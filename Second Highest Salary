# Second Highest Salary

get the second highest salary from the  `Employee`  table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+

**If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`**
####  MySQL
- IFNULL
```
# no next row - limit 1,1 will return an empty list. 
Instead of null, so a outer query is needed
# distinct  

SELECT(
SELECT DISTINCT Salary 
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1,1) AS SecondHighestSalary
```
- MAX()
```
# MAX() WILL RETURN NULL IF THERE IS NO VALUE 

SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)
```
